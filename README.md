# Dynamic Products - a Mod for Startup Company
This mod for Startup Company lets you dynamically create new producs, competitors and more in-game with an easily accessible UI.

Actually, there's a bit more to it and I plan on adding further features in the future.

Dynamic Products adds a new UI to the game which enables you to create your own competitors and product types (websites). Also, there are some presets which automatically add various product types and corresponding competitors.

Currently there are the following presets:
* Search Engine Pack
* Instant Messengers
* Language Learning
* Online Forum
* Travel Planning

I plan to include some of the features of my first, outdated mod More Products Deluxe. But there is a massive number of other ideas I've got which I'll try to implement in the future. Some of these ideas are:

* Upload your own images as competitor logos.
* Add a way to export and share custom products and so on.
* ~Implement custom features (I already started that one but I'm a little bit stuck :/)~
* Implement a feature to add components, modules and ~frameworks~.
* Improve the UX by adding validators and so on.
* List all previously added things.
* Edit things.
* Add translations (help needed!) [WIP]
  * ~German~ (by me)

Also, you can look forward to more presets bundled with future updates :).

Please, be so kind to report any bugs to me! Thanks <3
